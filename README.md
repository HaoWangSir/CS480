# CS 480: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Fall 2020

## Course Description

Introduction to computational methods for intelligent control of autonomous agents, and the use of programming paradigms that support development of flexible and reactive systems. These include heuristic search, knowledge representation, constraint satisfaction, probabilistic reasoning, decision-theoretic control, and sensor interpretation. Particular focus will be places on real-world application of the material.

## Prerequisites
